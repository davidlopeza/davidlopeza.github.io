# About Me

I am an undergraduate student in Computer Technologies Engineering at the Universidad de Monterrey (UDEM).  
My work focuses on user-centered design, front-end development, and the intersection between technology and human experience.  

I have one year of experience in UX/UI design at Fe de Nuevo León Foundation, where I contributed to improving digital accessibility and visual design consistency.  
Beyond that, I have built mobile applications and websites for academic and collaborative projects, always aiming to create intuitive and meaningful digital experiences.
